This was the code base that my team and I wrote for ME 218C, Stanford's Graduate Mechatronics course. Annually, ME 218C has a quarter long project in which we apply the skills we've picked up during the year (it's a quarter long sequence) and during that quarter as well. The project this quarter was to build soccer-playing hovercrafts that could be controlled remotely (and by soccer I mean: pushing around a wiffle ball). To witness how the project turned out, visit our website at this url: me218c2014.weebly.com. 

 The entire code is written in C and Assembly. We divided the code into 3 Parts: Coach (the controller), Player (the hovercraft), and LiKFIM (this was a device provided for the project, it was essentially a PIC16F690). I was personally responsible for the "Player" code base.
